# Day 4 Assignments

## 1. Arithmetic Expressions:
|Code	 				| Pass/Fail	| Why?																	|
|---	 				| ---		| ---																	|
|`assert(3 == 3.0);`			| Pass!		| This will pass because the left-hand side (integer) is implicitly converted to a float, and 3.0 == 3.0 is true.			|
|`float x = 3.1; assert(x == 3.1);`	| Pass!		| Because we set x to the float literal 3.1, it would make sense it is exactly the same value as the literal 3.1 in the comparison.	|
