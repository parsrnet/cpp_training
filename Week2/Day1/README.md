# Week 2, Day 1 - Functions
## Assignment 1: Float Precision
View my code [here](https://github.com/parsrnet/cpp_training/tree/main/Week2/Day1/AssignFloatPrecision).
### Run make
### Run the program
You can enter a value either in fraction form (x/y) or in decimal form (x.y) and please note that x cannot be an implied 0, it must be explicitly written as 0.y.
Using a union and bitfields, we can very simply and effectively get the correct J value and N value. Negative numbers are not supported.

## Assignment 2: Const and Non-Const Functions
View my code [here](https://github.com/parsrnet/cpp_training/tree/main/Week2/Day1/AssignConstFunctions)
### Run make
### Run the program
This program will run the methods as defined in the implementation. You can see that we use const overloading to produce a different result based on if we are calling to a const-defined struct or non-const.

## Assignment 3:
